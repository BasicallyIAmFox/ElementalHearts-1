Elemental Hearts is a mod which adds a ton of new consumable items which increase your health (Like life crystals). They are based on all of the basic elements, (blocks, ores, etc.). This mod is VERY BALANCED.

As with all of my mods, I prefer quality of quantity. This mod is a great addition to any modded playthrough, which adds a use for all of your leftover/extra blocks and ores.
This mod spreads with progression, so that you can never become too powerful.

We currently have mod support with Thorium! If you are using the Thorium mod, you will have another bonus 20+ hearts based on those elements!
The same applies with the Calamity mod! Over 20 different Calamity exclusive items based on those elements!

We also have a list to see which hearts you have made / not! Change the key in the config!

This mod (currently) adds:
	 87 consumable items.
	 1 (Bullet Hell :)) boss.
	 Multiple translations for many different languages such as Russian, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese and Polish.

We also have a discord server, so I will make the invite as the "homepage". Hop on in, chat, and even contibute to the mod.
I also need some people to help make a wiki, that would be awesome!
Bottom line is, I need feedback. Please join the discord to help out with this mod and make the mod grow, thanks!

	 Fixed the boss statue recipe.
0.2.4
	 UI is now more transparent.
	 Fixed the glass heart not adding to the corresponding material.
	 Boss statue now also takes 25 wires, so that you can't accidentally make the spawner without a way to spawn it it.

	 Added compatability with the boss checklist.
	 Nerfed the menacing life staff a bit.
	 Refined the boss a bit, fixed his projectile's dust.
	 The boss now PROPERLY despawns.	 
0.2.2
	 New weapon: Menacing Life Staff: Casts heart shaped projectiles that suck life from anything it touches. 
	 Boss now has sounds when he changes phases.
	 Boss now emits red light.
	 MASSIVELY BUFFED the boss, now most attacks do twice the amount of damage.

	 Fixed the empty heart item, it now clears ALL the heart's stats, and also doesn't crash on use anymore.
0.2.1
	 Boss now available also for Crimson worlds
0.2
	 The boss is officially released!
	 You can craft his spawner with 5 life crystals, 100 stone, and 25 vile powder at a demon altar.
	 Have fun with the new boss! (He currently drops nothing in normal mode, I will create some stuff for him.)
	 Aside from the boss, we also STARTED calamity and thorium development. This includes the new hearts for both the mods :)
0.1.4
	 The boss is now able to be spawned with the Menacing Statue.
	 The statue is currently not able to be crafted atm.
	 Added the Menacing Looking Pendant, an expert drop that increases max hp by 25 and life regen by 5.
0.1.3.1
	 Small change, made the dev sets only obtainable in hardmode!
0.1.3
	 LOTS OF BOSS AI PROGRESS!! I would say, the boss ai is done! Next update will (probably) add in the spawner and a few drops from the boss.
	 I will also release a video of the boss (preferable no-hit if im able to)!
0.1.2
	 Changed boss music type to mp3, hopefully fixes an error.
	 MAJOR boss AI progress, boss is almost ready to go in next update!
0.1.1
	 Added a few bits of optimization to the boss's code, but no big differences to the boss's AI.
0.1.0.1
	 Added Github Authorization for an icon and music.
0.1:
	 This is the first release of the mod. Added in 87 different heart containers. This mod has been in development for over a few months before this release, because first impressions matter.
	 In the past 2 days, (as Im writing this) I have been going through each and every item to check and make sure everything works.
	 The pre-hardmode boss's (Menacing Heart) AI has not been finished, and therefore is unspawnable without cheats. I intend the boss to be available in the next update.
