Elemental Hearts is a mod which adds a ton of new consumable items which increase your health (Like life crystals). They are based on all of the basic elements, (blocks, ores, etc.). This mod is VERY BALANCED.

As with all of my mods, I prefer quality of quantity. This mod is a great addition to any modded playthrough, which adds a use for all of your leftover/extra blocks and ores.
This mod spreads with progression, so that you can never become too powerful.

We currently have mod support with Thorium! If you are using the Thorium mod, you will have another bonus 20+ hearts based on those elements!
The same applies with the Calamity mod! Over 20 different Calamity exclusive items based on those elements!

We also have a list to see which hearts you have made / not! Change the key in the config!

This mod (currently) adds:
	 87 consumable items.
	 1 (Bullet Hell :)) boss.
	 Multiple translations for many different languages such as Russian, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese and Polish.

0.1:
	 This is the first release of the mod. Added in 87 different heart containers. This mod has been in development for over a few months before this release, because first impressions matter.
	 In the past 2 days, (as Im writing this) I have been going through each and every item to check and make sure everything works.
	 The pre-hardmode boss's (Menacing Heart) AI has not been finished, and therefore is unspawnable without cheats. I intend the boss to be available in the next update.
