Elemental Hearts is a mod which adds a ton of new consumable items which increase your health (Like life crystals). They are based on all of the basic elements, (blocks, ores, etc.). This mod is VERY BALANCED.

As with all of my mods, I prefer quality of quantity. This mod is a great addition to any modded playthrough, which adds a use for all of your leftover/extra blocks and ores.
This mod spreads with progression, so that you can never become too powerful.
In the future, we will also add suport for mods like Calamity and Thorium.

This mod adds:
	 49 one time consumable items.

Change-Log:

1.1:
	This is just the initial set-up of the mod, few of the sprites, a few of the items. Mostly just to initialize the mod browser etc.
