Elemental Hearts is a mod which adds a ton of new consumable items which increase your health (Like life crystals). They are based on all of the basic elements, (blocks, ores, etc.). This mod is VERY BALANCED.

As with all of my mods, I prefer quality of quantity. This mod is a great addition to any modded playthrough, which adds a use for all of your leftover/extra blocks and ores.
This mod spreads with progression, so that you can never become too powerful.
In the future, we will also add support for mods like Calamity and Thorium.

This mod (currently) adds:
	 87 consumable items.
	 1 (Bullet Hell :)) boss.
	 Multiple translations for many different languages such as Russian, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese and Polish.

We also have a discord server, so I will make the invite as the "homepage". Hop on in, chat, and even contibute to the mod.
I also need some people to help make a wiki, that would be awesome!
Bottom line is, I need feedback. Please join the discord to help out with this mod and make the mod grow, thanks!

Change-Log:
0.2
	 The boss is officially released!
	 You can craft his spawner with 5 life crystals, 100 stone, and 25 vile powder at a demon altar.
	 Have fun with the new boss! (He currently drops nothing in normal mode, I will create some stuff for him.)
	 Aside from the boss, we also STARTED calamity and thorium development. This includes the new hearts for both the mods :)
0.1.4
	 The boss is now able to be spawned with the Menacing Statue.
	 The statue is currently not able to be crafted atm.
	 Added the Menacing Looking Pendant, an expert drop that increases max hp by 25 and life regen by 5.
0.1.3.1
	 Small change, made the dev sets only obtainable in hardmode!
0.1.3
	 LOTS OF BOSS AI PROGRESS!! I would say, the boss ai is done! Next update will (probably) add in the spawner and a few drops from the boss.
	 I will also release a video of the boss (preferable no-hit if im able to)!
0.1.2
	 Changed boss music type to mp3, hopefully fixes an error.
	 MAJOR boss AI progress, boss is almost ready to go in next update!
0.1.1
	 Added a few bits of optimization to the boss's code, but no big differences to the boss's AI.
0.1.0.1
	 Added Github Authorization for an icon and music.
0.1:
	 This is the first release of the mod. Added in 87 different heart containers. This mod has been in development for over a few months before this release, because first impressions matter.
	 In the past 2 days, (as Im writing this) I have been going through each and every item to check and make sure everything works.
	 The pre-hardmode boss's (Menacing Heart) AI has not been finished, and therefore is unspawnable without cheats. I intend the boss to be available in the next update.
